# Markowitz Efficient Frontier Simulation and Optimization

![Efficient Frontier Visualization](mef-visualization.png)

When it comes to the stock market, one of the most well-known sayings is "don't put all your eggs in one basket." In practice, this means diversifying (spreading your money) into multiple assets to minimize risk.

Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is this concept given mathematical rigor. It allows investors to create optimized portfolios that have maximal expected returns for a given level of risk, and it does so by combining assets that don't move perfectly together (low correlation).

In this project, we will take 10 relatively uncorrelated stocks and simulate 10,000 random weightings to find the efficient frontier (the point where you cannot achieve higher return without taking on more risk). In other words, we are answering the following question:

"Given these 10 stocks, how much of each should I hold to get the maximum possible return for my comfort level?"
